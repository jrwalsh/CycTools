Slot: CREDITS
"This slot attributes credit to various contributors
which can be individual people or organizations
or both. The type of contribution is indicated by several 
types of annotation labels that are attached to the slot values
each of them bearing numerical time-stamps as the values
in Common Lisp universal time format
that indicate the approximate times of the contributions. The 
code dealing with author-crediting sets and shows the timestamps 
with a precision of one day. The legal slot values are frames of the
|People| or |Organizations| classes in any combination or order. 
Each such contributor frame is assumed to occur only once in 
the slot. As of Oct. 2005 the legal annotation labels are: 
CREATED REVIEWED REVISED LAST-CURATED . 
For the annotation labels CREATED and LAST-CURATED
it only makes sense to store one timestamp but for the other 
labels in general arbitrarily many timestamps can be recorded. 
An association between authors and organizations is assumed 
if they share the same credit event in terms of the same 
combination of annotation label and timestamp."

Slot: LAST-UPDATE
"This slot stores the date on which some significant curation last 
occurred for this gene. Because that information must be computed 
from the RDBMS logs which takes a long time this slot is populated 
in a batch off-line mode such as at PGDB release time. Currently 
it is populated for EcoCyc only. Its value is computed using function 
gene-last-update-date. See that function for documentation on exactly 
what is meant by some significant curation."

Slot: GO-TERMS
"This slot contains all GO terms to which this object is annotated. 
Its values should be annotated with citations including evidence codes."
